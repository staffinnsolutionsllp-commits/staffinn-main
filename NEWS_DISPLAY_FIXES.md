# News Display Issues - Fixes Implemented

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. News Count Not Showing in Recruiter Dashboard
**Problem**: The "My News (0)" was always showing 0 even when news was added.
**Fix**: 
- Added proper debugging to `loadRecruiterNews()` function
- Ensured news data is properly loaded and state is updated after adding/editing news
- Added console logging to track news loading process

### 2. News Cards Not Displaying in recruiter-news-section
**Problem**: News cards were not being rendered properly in the dashboard.
**Fix**:
- Created comprehensive CSS styles in `NewsStyles.css`
- Added proper grid layout for news cards
- Implemented hover effects and responsive design
- Imported CSS in both RecruiterDashboard and NewsPage components

### 3. Banner Images Not Appearing on News Page
**Problem**: Uploaded banner images were not displaying on the News Page.
**Fixes**:
- **Backend S3 Service**: Modified to use permanent public URLs instead of pre-signed URLs
- **Recruiter News Controller**: Updated to use `s3Service.getFileUrl()` for permanent URLs
- **News Controller**: Added `bannerImage` field to transformed news data
- **Frontend NewsPage**: Enhanced image handling with fallback URLs and error handling
- **S3 Upload**: Added `ACL: 'public-read'` to make files publicly accessible

## Files Modified

## Key Technical Changes

### 1. S3 URL Management
- **Before**: Used pre-signed URLs that expire after 7 days
- **After**: Use permanent public URLs with proper ACL settings
- **Benefit**: Images remain accessible indefinitely

### 2. Image Fallback Strategy
```javascript
// Enhanced image handling with multiple fallback options
<img 
  src={article.image || article.originalData?.bannerImage || "fallback-url"} 
  alt={article.title}
  onError={(e) => {
    e.target.src = "fallback-url";
  }}
/>
```

### 3. News Data Structure
- Added `bannerImage` field to all news transformations
- Preserved `originalData` for accessing raw banner image URLs
- Added verification status display

### 4. CSS Architecture
- Modular CSS file specifically for news components
- Consistent styling across dashboard and news page
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Add News**: Test adding news with banner images in recruiter dashboard
2. **View Count**: Verify that "My News (X)" shows correct count after adding news
3. **News Page**: Check that banner images display correctly on the main news page
4. **Image Fallback**: Test with broken image URLs to verify fallback works
5. **Responsive**: Test on mobile devices to ensure proper layout

Ensure these environment variables are set in your `.env` file:
```
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
