# Profile Population Implementation

## Problem Statement
When staff members register on the website and fill in their details (name, email, phone number, password), only the email appears pre-filled in the "My Profile" section. The other registration entries (name, phone number) should also automatically appear in the user's profile as soon as the account is created.

## Solution Overview
The issue was that during staff registration, the user data was being stored correctly in the database, but the profile form was not being properly populated with this registration data when the user accessed their profile.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### A. Staff Controller (`controllers/staffController.js`)
- **Updated `registerStaff` function**: Modified the staff profile creation to use the validated registration form data directly instead of relying on the user object
- **Key Changes**:
  - Changed `userData` to use proper field names (`fullName`, `phoneNumber`)
  - Updated `staffProfileData` to use validated form data (`value.fullName`, `value.phoneNumber`)
  - Fixed response object to return correct field names

#### B. Staff Model (`models/staffModel.js`)
- **Updated `getStaffProfile` function**: Added logic to merge user registration data with profile data
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added user data retrieval within profile loading
  - Implemented fallback logic: `profile.fullName = profile.fullName || userData.fullName`
  - Ensures registration data is always available even if profile data is incomplete

#### C. User Model (`models/userModel.js`)
- **Cleaned up user creation**: Ensured proper field mapping for staff users
- **Key Changes**:
  - Maintained consistent field names (`fullName`, `phoneNumber`)
  - Removed insecure password storage attempts

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Registration Flow
1. User fills registration form with: `fullName`, `email`, `phoneNumber`, `password`
2. Data is validated and stored in `users` table with correct field names
3. Staff profile is created with the same registration data pre-populated
4. All fields are now available when user accesses their profile

#### Profile Loading Flow
1. When user opens "My Profile", system retrieves staff profile
2. System also retrieves user registration data as fallback
3. Profile form is populated with merged data (profile data takes priority, user data as fallback)
4. All registration fields now appear pre-filled

### 3. Security Considerations
- Password is properly hashed and stored securely
- No plain text passwords are stored or transmitted
- User data access is properly authenticated

### 4. Testing
- Created test script (`test-profile-population.js`) to verify functionality
- Test covers full registration → profile creation → profile retrieval flow
- Verifies all registration fields are properly populated

## Expected Behavior After Implementation

### Before Fix
- User registers with: Name="John Doe", Email="john@example.com", Phone="+91-9876543210"
- User opens "My Profile"
- Only email field is pre-filled: Email="john@example.com"
- Name and phone fields are empty

### After Fix
- User registers with: Name="John Doe", Email="john@example.com", Phone="+91-9876543210"
- User opens "My Profile"
- All fields are pre-filled:
  - Full Name: "John Doe"
  - Email: "john@example.com"
  - Phone: "+91-9876543210"

## Files Modified
1. `Backend/controllers/staffController.js` - Updated registration and profile logic
2. `Backend/models/staffModel.js` - Enhanced profile retrieval with user data merging
3. `Backend/models/userModel.js` - Cleaned up user creation logic

## Files Created
1. `Backend/test-profile-population.js` - Test script for verification
2. `PROFILE_POPULATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Deployment Notes
- Changes are backward compatible
- Existing user profiles will benefit from the enhanced data merging
- No database migrations required
- Feature works immediately after deployment

## Verification Steps
1. Register a new staff account with complete details
2. Login and navigate to "My Profile"
3. Verify all registration fields are pre-populated
4. Test both "Active Staff" and "Seeker" modes
5. Confirm existing users also see their registration data

The implementation ensures that the current workflow and existing modals remain completely unchanged while providing the requested auto-population feature.
