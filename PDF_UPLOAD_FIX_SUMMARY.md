# PDF Upload and Public Viewing Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The PDF files in the Industry Collaborations section were not being uploaded permanently and were not publicly viewable. Users could not click on PDF links in the public institute details page to view MOU documents.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **PDF URL Preservation Issue**: The backend logic for preserving existing PDF URLs when updating industry collaborations was flawed
2. **S3 Public Access**: PDF files were not being uploaded with public-read permissions
3. **URL Validation**: Inconsistent validation of PDF URLs in the database model
4. **Frontend Display**: PDF links were not properly handled for public viewing

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Backend Controller Fixes (`instituteController.js`)

#### Fixed PDF URL Preservation Logic
```javascript
// BEFORE: Simple index-based preservation (unreliable)
if (!existingCollabData?.mouItems?.[i]?.pdfUrl) {
    mou.pdfUrl = null;
} else {
    mou.pdfUrl = existingCollabData.mouItems[i].pdfUrl;
}

// AFTER: Smart matching by title with fallback to index
const existingMou = existingCollabData?.mouItems?.find(existing => 
    existing.title === mou.title
) || existingCollabData?.mouItems?.[i];

if (existingMou && existingMou.pdfUrl && typeof existingMou.pdfUrl === 'string' && existingMou.pdfUrl.includes('http')) {
    mou.pdfUrl = existingMou.pdfUrl;
    console.log(`Preserved existing PDF URL for ${mou.title}: ${mou.pdfUrl}`);
} else {
    mou.pdfUrl = null;
    console.log(`Set PDF URL to null for ${mou.title}`);
}
```

#### Added Public S3 Upload Permissions
```javascript
const uploadCommand = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: S3_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: key,
    Body: file.buffer,
    ContentType: contentType,
    CacheControl: 'max-age=31536000',
    ACL: 'public-read' // Make files publicly accessible
});
```

#### Enhanced Public API Response
```javascript
// Added detailed logging and validation for public API
mouItems: (collabSection.mouItems || []).filter(mou => 
    mou.title && mou.description
).map(mou => ({
    ...mou,
    pdfUrl: mou.pdfUrl && typeof mou.pdfUrl === 'string' && mou.pdfUrl.includes('http') ? mou.pdfUrl : null
}))
```

#### Added PDF Serving Endpoint
```javascript
const serveMouPdf = async (req, res) => {
    const { filename } = req.params;
    
    // Validate filename to prevent directory traversal
    if (!filename || filename.includes('..') || filename.includes('/')) {
        return res.status(400).json({
            success: false,
            message: 'Invalid filename'
        });
    }
    
    const pdfUrl = `https://${S3_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.${process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1'}.amazonaws.com/industry-collab-pdfs/${filename}`;
    res.redirect(pdfUrl);
};
```

### 2. Database Model Fixes (`instituteIndustryCollabModel.js`)

#### Enhanced Data Validation
```javascript
// Added URL validation during save
collaborationCards: (collabData.collaborationCards || []).map(card => ({
    ...card,
    image: card.image && typeof card.image === 'string' && card.image.includes('http') ? card.image : null
})),
mouItems: (collabData.mouItems || []).map(mou => ({
    ...mou,
    pdfUrl: mou.pdfUrl && typeof mou.pdfUrl === 'string' && mou.pdfUrl.includes('http') ? mou.pdfUrl : null
}))
```

#### Improved Logging
```javascript
console.log('Saving collaboration data with validated URLs:', {
    collaborationCards: collaborationSection.collaborationCards.length,
    mouItems: collaborationSection.mouItems.length,
    mouItemsWithPdfs: collaborationSection.mouItems.filter(mou => mou.pdfUrl).length
});
```

### 3. Routes Configuration (`instituteRoutes.js`)

#### Added PDF Serving Route
```javascript
// Public PDF serving route (no authentication required)
router.get('/mou-pdf/:filename', serveMouPdf);
```

### 4. Frontend Fixes

#### Enhanced Public Page PDF Links (`InstitutePage.jsx`)
```javascript
// Added click logging and improved styling
<a 
    href={validPdf} 
    target="_blank" 
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    className="mou-download-link"
    style={{
        display: 'inline-block',
        marginTop: '10px',
        padding: '8px 16px',
        backgroundColor: '#007bff',
        color: 'white',
        textDecoration: 'none',
        borderRadius: '4px',
        fontSize: '14px',
        cursor: 'pointer'
    }}
    onClick={(e) => {
        console.log('PDF link clicked:', validPdf);
    }}
>
    ðŸ“„ View MOU Document
</a>
```

#### Enhanced Dashboard PDF Links (`InstituteDashboard.jsx`)
```javascript
// Added click logging for dashboard PDF links
onClick={(e) => {
    console.log('Dashboard PDF link clicked:', mou.pdfUrl);
}}
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Permanent Storage**
- PDFs are now uploaded to S3 with permanent URLs
- URLs are properly preserved during updates
- Old PDFs are cleaned up when replaced

### 2. **Public Accessibility**
- All PDF files are uploaded with `public-read` ACL
- Direct S3 URLs are publicly accessible
- No authentication required to view PDFs

### 3. **Robust URL Handling**
- Smart matching of existing MOUs by title
- Fallback to index-based matching
- Comprehensive URL validation

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
- Detailed logging throughout the upload process
- Clear indication of PDF preservation vs. new uploads
- Public API response logging for debugging

### 5. **Error Prevention**
- Filename validation to prevent directory traversal
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid PDFs
- Proper error messages for debugging

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Upload new MOU with PDF
- [ ] Update existing MOU without changing PDF (should preserve)
- [ ] Update existing MOU with new PDF (should replace)
- [ ] Delete MOU item (should clean up PDF)
- [ ] Public API returns valid PDF URLs
- [ ] Direct S3 URLs are accessible

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Dashboard shows "View PDF" links for existing PDFs
- [ ] Dashboard allows uploading new PDFs
- [ ] Public page displays PDF links
- [ ] PDF links open in new tab/window
- [ ] PDFs are viewable in browser
- [ ] Error handling for missing PDFs

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Complete workflow: Upload â†’ Save â†’ Public View â†’ Click PDF
- [ ] Multiple MOUs with different PDFs
- [ ] Update workflow preserves unmodified PDFs
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility for PDF viewing

## Environment Requirements
- AWS S3 bucket with public read permissions
- Proper AWS credentials configured
- S3_BUCKET_NAME environment variable set
- AWS_REGION environment variable set

## Security Considerations
- Filename validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Only PDF files are accepted for MOU uploads
- File size limits (10MB) prevent abuse
- Public access is limited to uploaded files only

This implementation ensures that PDF files are permanently stored, publicly accessible, and properly displayed in both the dashboard and public institute pages.
