# Placement Section Image Preservation Fix

## Problem Description
In the Institute's My Dashboard, under the Placements section, there was an issue where uploaded images for Top Hiring Companies and Recent Placement Success would disappear when clicking "Update Placement Section". The images were being uploaded successfully but were not being preserved during subsequent updates.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the placement section update workflow:

1. **Frontend Issue**: When loading existing placement data, images were stored as URLs in both `logo`/`photo` and `logoPreview`/`photoPreview` fields
2. **API Processing Issue**: The API service was not properly distinguishing between new file uploads and existing image URLs
3. **Backend Logic Issue**: The backend was not correctly preserving existing image URLs when no new files were uploaded

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Backend Controller Fix (`instituteController.js`)
**File**: `Backend/controllers/instituteController.js`

**Changes Made**:
- Simplified the `updatePlacementSection` function to properly handle existing images
- Removed unnecessary `fileMapping` parameter processing
- Added clear logic to preserve existing URLs when no new files are uploaded
- Improved error handling and logging

**Key Fix**:
```javascript
// Process company logos with unique identifiers
if (placementData.topHiringCompanies && Array.isArray(placementData.topHiringCompanies)) {
  for (let i = 0; i < placementData.topHiringCompanies.length; i++) {
    const company = placementData.topHiringCompanies[i];
    
    // Check if there's a new file to upload
    if (company.hasNewFile && company.fileId) {
      const fileFieldName = `companyLogo_${company.fileId}`;
      const file = files[fileFieldName];
      
      if (file && file.length > 0) {
        try {
          const logoUrls = await uploadPlacementFiles([file[0]], 'company-logos');
          if (logoUrls[0]) {
            company.logo = logoUrls[0];
          }
        } catch (uploadError) {
          console.error(`Error uploading company logo for ${company.name}:`, uploadError);
        }
      }
    }
    // If no new file, preserve existing logo URL
    // The logo field should already contain the existing URL from frontend
    
    // Clean up temporary properties
    delete company.hasNewFile;
    delete company.fileId;
  }
}
```

### 2. Frontend API Service Fix (`api.js`)
**File**: `Frontend/src/services/api.js`

**Changes Made**:
- Improved the `updatePlacementSection` function to properly handle existing images
- Added explicit flags (`hasNewFile`) to distinguish between new uploads and existing URLs
- Simplified the file processing logic
- Removed unnecessary `fileMapping` complexity

**Key Fix**:
```javascript
if (company.logo && company.logo instanceof File) {
  // Add file with unique identifier
  formData.append(`companyLogo_${companyId}`, company.logo);
  // Mark that this company has a new file
  company.hasNewFile = true;
  company.fileId = companyId;
  // Remove the File object from the data (will be handled by backend)
  company.logo = null;
} else if (company.logoPreview && !company.logoPreview.startsWith('blob:')) {
  // Keep existing URL if it's not a blob URL (existing image from server)
  company.logo = company.logoPreview;
  company.hasNewFile = false;
} else {
  // No image at all
  company.logo = null;
  company.hasNewFile = false;
}
```

### 3. Frontend Component Fix (`InstituteDashboard.jsx`)
**File**: `Frontend/src/Components/Dashboard/InstituteDashboard.jsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `loadPlacementSectionData` to properly preserve existing image URLs
- Modified `handlePlacementSectionSubmit` to include all necessary data for proper processing
- Added comments to clarify image preservation logic

**Key Fix**:
```javascript
const placementData = {
  averageSalary: placementSectionForm.averageSalary,
  highestPackage: placementSectionForm.highestPackage,
  topHiringCompanies: placementSectionForm.topHiringCompanies.map(company => ({
    id: company.id, // Include ID for tracking
    name: company.name,
    logo: company.logo, // This will be either a File object (new) or URL string (existing)
    logoPreview: company.logoPreview // Include preview for processing
  })),
  recentPlacementSuccess: placementSectionForm.recentPlacementSuccess.map(placement => ({
    id: placement.id, // Include ID for tracking
    name: placement.name,
    company: placement.company,
    position: placement.position,
    photo: placement.photo, // This will be either a File object (new) or URL string (existing)
    photoPreview: placement.photoPreview // Include preview for processing
  }))
};
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Created `Backend/test-placement-fix.js` to verify the fix:
- Tests initial data insertion with images
- Simulates update without new files
- Verifies that existing images are preserved
- Confirms that other data updates work correctly
- Cleans up test data

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Login to Institute Dashboard
   - Navigate to Placements tab
   - Add companies with logos and students with photos
   - Click "Update Placement Section"
   - Verify images are saved and visible

2. **Image Preservation Test**:
   - Make text-only changes (e.g., update salary values)
   - Click "Update Placement Section"
   - Verify that all existing images remain visible
   - Confirm that text changes were saved

3. **Mixed Update Test**:
   - Keep some existing images
   - Upload new images for other entries
   - Update some text fields
   - Click "Update Placement Section"
   - Verify that existing images are preserved and new images are uploaded

## Key Benefits

1. **Image Preservation**: Existing images are now properly preserved during updates
2. **Workflow Integrity**: The existing modal and workflow remain completely unchanged
3. **Data Consistency**: All placement section data is maintained correctly
4. **User Experience**: No more frustrating image loss during updates
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing data and functionality remain intact

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Load**: Existing images loaded as URLs in both `logo`/`photo` and `logoPreview`/`photoPreview`
2. **Edit**: User can modify text or upload new images
3. **Submit**: API distinguishes between File objects (new uploads) and URL strings (existing images)
4. **Process**: Backend uploads new files and preserves existing URLs
5. **Save**: All data saved to database with proper image references

### File Handling Logic
- **New Files**: Detected as `File` objects, uploaded to S3, URLs stored in database
- **Existing Images**: Detected as URL strings, preserved as-is in database
- **No Images**: Handled gracefully with null values

### Error Handling
- Upload failures are logged but don't prevent other data from saving
- Malformed data is caught and reported with clear error messages
- Database operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks

## Deployment Notes

1. **No Database Changes**: The fix works with existing database schema
2. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact
3. **Immediate Effect**: Changes take effect immediately after deployment
4. **No Migration Required**: Existing data continues to work without modification

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the image disappearing issue while maintaining the existing workflow and user experience. The solution is minimal, focused, and preserves all current functionality while adding robust image preservation capabilities.
