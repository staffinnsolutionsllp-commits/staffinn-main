# Profile Photo Upload Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When recruiters register and go to "My Profile" to upload a photo, the photo uploads once but then gets removed automatically and doesn't show up again as the profile picture.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Port Mismatch Issue
- **Backend**: Server runs on port 4001 (default) but was generating URLs with port 4000
- **Frontend**: Was expecting URLs with port 5000
- **Result**: Photos were uploaded but URLs were incorrect, causing images to fail loading

### 2. Complex State Management
- The frontend had complex temporary photo state logic that could cause photos to be lost
- Multiple state variables (`profilePhoto`, `tempProfilePhoto`) were not being managed consistently

### 3. URL Generation Inconsistency
- Backend was hardcoding port 4000 instead of using the actual server port
- Frontend was using different ports for different operations

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes (`recruiterController.js`)

1. **Fixed URL Generation**:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   const photoUrl = `http://localhost:4000/uploads/${req.file.filename}`;
   
   // After
   const serverPort = process.env.PORT || 4001;
   const photoUrl = `http://localhost:${serverPort}/uploads/${req.file.filename}`;
   ```

2. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging for profile photo updates
   - Better tracking of photo persistence in database

### Frontend Changes (`RecruiterDashboard.jsx`)

1. **Fixed Port Consistency**:
   ```javascript
   // Updated all photo URL handling to use port 4001
   const fullPhotoUrl = profile.profilePhoto.startsWith('http') 
     ? profile.profilePhoto 
     : `http://localhost:4001${profile.profilePhoto}`;
   ```

2. **Simplified State Management**:
   - Streamlined the profile photo update logic
   - Removed complex null checking that could cause photo removal
   - Improved the profile form submission handling

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added file type and size validation
   - Better error messages for upload failures
   - Improved photo loading error handling

## Key Changes Made

### File: `Backend/controllers/recruiterController.js`
- Line ~570: Fixed photo URL generation to use correct server port
- Enhanced logging for photo upload debugging

### File: `Frontend/src/Components/Dashboard/RecruiterDashboard.jsx`
- Line ~350: Fixed profile photo loading URL
- Line ~390: Fixed photo upload URL handling  
- Line ~420: Fixed office image upload URL
- Line ~460: Fixed office images loading URL
- Line ~650: Simplified profile form submission logic

## Testing Steps

1. **Register as a recruiter**
2. **Go to "My Profile" tab**
3. **Upload a profile photo**
4. **Verify photo appears immediately**
5. **Click "Update Profile & Go Live"**
6. **Verify photo persists after page refresh**
7. **Check that photo appears in sidebar and public profile**

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ Photo uploads successfully
2. ✅ Photo appears immediately in dashboard
3. ✅ Photo persists after "Update Profile & Go Live"
4. ✅ Photo remains visible after page refresh
5. ✅ Photo appears in sidebar company logo
6. ✅ Photo syncs across all components using the profile photo hook

## Additional Improvements

1. **File Validation**: Added 5MB size limit and image type validation
2. **Better UX**: Clearer upload messages and error handling
3. **Consistent URLs**: All photo URLs now use the correct server port
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information for troubleshooting

## Notes

- The server runs on port 4001 by default (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- All photo URLs are now dynamically generated using the actual server port
- The profile photo sync hook ensures photos update across all components
- Photos are stored in the `recruiter-profiles` DynamoDB table, separate from user registration data
