# News Integration Implementation

## Overview
This implementation connects the recruiter news functionality with the public News page, ensuring that when recruiters add news from their dashboard, it immediately appears in both the dashboard cards and the public News page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New News Controller (`Backend/controllers/newsController.js`)
- **getAllNews()**: Aggregates news from both institutes and recruiters for the public news page
- **getNewsByCategory()**: Filters news by category (institute, recruiter, staff)
- Transforms data to match the News page format with proper categorization

#### New News Routes (`Backend/routes/newsRoutes.js`)
- `GET /api/v1/news/all` - Get all news (institute + recruiter)
- `GET /api/v1/news/category/:category` - Get news by specific category

#### Enhanced Models
- **recruiterNewsModel.js**: Added `getAllPublic()` method to fetch all recruiter news
- **instituteEventNewsModel.js**: Added `getAllPublic()` method to fetch all institute events/news

#### Server Configuration (`Backend/server.js`)
- Added news routes to the main server configuration

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Enhanced API Service (`Frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- **getAllNews()**: Fetches all news from the new endpoint
- **getNewsByCategory()**: Fetches news by category

#### Updated NewsPage Component (`Frontend/src/Components/Pages/NewsPage.jsx`)
- Replaced dummy data with real API calls
- Added loading states for better user experience
- Integrated real-time news data from both institutes and recruiters
- Maintains existing UI/UX while using real data

#### Enhanced Recruiter Dashboard (`Frontend/src/Components/Dashboard/RecruiterDashboard.jsx`)
- Improved news card display in the overview tab
- Added "Add News" button directly in the overview section
- Enhanced card design with hover effects and better visual hierarchy
- Added verification status indicators
- Improved empty state with call-to-action buttons

#### Updated Styles (`Frontend/src/Components/Pages/NewsPage.css`)
- Added loading animation styles
- Enhanced visual feedback for loading states

### 3. Data Flow

```
Recruiter Dashboard → Add News → Backend API → Database
                                      ↓
News Page ← Frontend API Call ← News Controller ← Database
```

#### When a recruiter adds news:
1. News is saved to the recruiter-news table with recruiter information
2. News immediately appears in the recruiter's dashboard as a card
3. News becomes available on the public News page in both "All News" and "Recruiter News" sections

#### News page data sources:
- **All News**: Combined institute events/news + recruiter news
- **Institute News**: Only institute events and news
- **Recruiter News**: Only recruiter news
- **Staffinn News**: Placeholder for future staff news

### 4. Key Features

- Consistent data format across all displays

#### Enhanced User Experience
- Loading states while fetching news
- Hover effects and visual feedback

- Adds display properties (likes, comments, etc.) for UI consistency
- Proper date formatting and categorization
- Image URL handling with fallbacks

### 6. Testing

#### Test Script (`Backend/test-news-endpoints.js`)
- Verifies all new API endpoints
- Tests data aggregation functionality
- Validates response formats
- Provides sample data inspection

### 7. Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `controllers/newsController.js` (NEW)
- ✅ `routes/newsRoutes.js` (NEW)
- ✅ `models/recruiterNewsModel.js` (MODIFIED - added getAllPublic)
- ✅ `models/instituteEventNewsModel.js` (MODIFIED - added getAllPublic)
- ✅ `server.js` (MODIFIED - added news routes)
- ✅ `test-news-endpoints.js` (NEW - testing script)

#### Frontend Files
- ✅ `services/api.js` (MODIFIED - added news API methods)
- ✅ `Components/Pages/NewsPage.jsx` (MODIFIED - real data integration)
- ✅ `Components/Pages/NewsPage.css` (MODIFIED - loading styles)
