# Recruiter News Display Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Banner Images Not Displaying in News Feed
**Problem**: Uploaded banner images were not showing in the news-feed on the NewsPage.

**Root Cause**: The image field mapping was inconsistent between the backend data structure and frontend display logic.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `NewsPage.jsx` to prioritize `bannerImage` field over `image` field
- Modified `newsController.js` to ensure both `image` and `bannerImage` fields are properly set
- Added proper fallback handling for missing images

### 2. News Not Appearing in Recruiter Dashboard
**Problem**: Added news was not immediately visible in the recruiter dashboard news section.

**Root Cause**: The news data was not being refreshed properly after adding/updating/deleting news items.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `loadRecruiterNews()` function with force refresh capability
- Added proper sorting by creation date
- Implemented delayed refresh mechanism to ensure backend processing is complete
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging logs

### 3. Banner Image Upload Issues
**Problem**: Banner images were being uploaded but URLs might not be generated correctly.

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent URL generation between upload result and manual URL construction.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `recruiterNewsController.js` to use `uploadResult.Location` as primary source
- Added fallback to `s3Service.getFileUrl(key)` if Location is not available
- Enhanced logging for banner image upload success/failure

## Files Modified

## Key Improvements

### 1. Force Refresh Mechanism
```javascript
const loadRecruiterNews = async (forceRefresh = false) => {
    if (forceRefresh) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    }
    // ... rest of the function
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Image Display Logic
```javascript
// NewsPage.jsx
<img 
    src={article.bannerImage || article.image || article.originalData?.bannerImage || "placeholder"} 
    alt={article.title}
    onError={(e) => {
        e.target.src = "placeholder";
    }}
/>
```

### 3. Improved Banner Image Upload
```javascript
// recruiterNewsController.js
const uploadResult = await s3Service.uploadFile(req.file, key);
bannerImageUrl = uploadResult.Location || s3Service.getFileUrl(key);
console.log('Banner image uploaded successfully:', bannerImageUrl);
```
