## Data Structure Mapping

### Course Object Structure
```javascript
{
  coursesId: "uuid",           // Primary key
  instituteId: "uuid",         // Institute reference
  courseName: "string",        // Course name (maps to 'name' in frontend)
  duration: "string",          // e.g., "6 months"
  fees: number,                // Course fees
  instructor: "string",        // Instructor name
  category: "string",          // Course category
  mode: "string",              // Online/Offline
  thumbnailUrl: "string",      // S3 URL for thumbnail
  description: "string",       // Course description
  prerequisites: "string",     // Prerequisites
  syllabusOverview: "string",  // Syllabus overview
  certification: "string",     // Certification type
  modules: [                   // Array of modules
    {
      moduleId: "uuid",
      moduleTitle: "string",
      moduleDescription: "string",
      order: number,
      content: [               // Array of content
        {
          contentId: "uuid",
          contentTitle: "string",
          contentType: "video|assignment|quiz",
          contentUrl: "string", // S3 URL
          order: number,
          durationMinutes: number,
          mandatory: boolean
        }
      ],
      quiz: {                  // Optional quiz
        quizId: "uuid",
        title: "string",
        description: "string",
        passingScore: number,
        timeLimit: number,
        maxAttempts: number,
        questions: [...]
      }
    }
  ],
  isActive: boolean,
  createdAt: "ISO string",
  updatedAt: "ISO string"
}
```

### Enrollment Object Structure
```javascript
{
  enrolledID: "uuid",          // Primary key
  userId: "uuid",              // User reference
  courseId: "uuid",            // Course reference (FIXED - no longer undefined)
  courseName: "string",        // Course name for display
  instituteId: "uuid",         // Institute reference
  enrollmentDate: "ISO string",
  progressPercentage: number,  // 0-100
  status: "active|completed",
  paymentStatus: "free|paid"
}
```

## S3 File Structure
```
staffinn-files/
└── staffinn-courses-content/
    └── courses/
        ├── thumbnails/
        │   └── {courseId}.{ext}
        ├── videos/
        │   └── {courseId}_{moduleId}_{contentId}.{ext}
        ├── assignments/
        │   └── {courseId}_{moduleId}_{contentId}.pdf
        └── content/
            └── {courseId}_{moduleId}_{contentId}.{ext}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   node test-course-creation.js
   ```

2. **Test course creation manually**:
   - Login as institute
   - Go to Course Management
   - Click "Add New Course"
   - Fill in course details
   - Add modules with content
   - Upload files (videos, assignments)
   - Submit form

3. **Test enrollment**:
   - Login as student/staff
   - Navigate to institute page
   - Click on a course
   - Click "Enroll Now"
   - Verify enrollment is created with correct courseId

4. **Test learning page**:
   - After enrollment, click "Continue Learning"
   - Verify course content loads properly
   - Check video playback
   - Test quiz functionality

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. ✅ Course creation works with proper file uploads
2. ✅ Course names display correctly (no more garbled text)
3. ✅ Thumbnails show on course cards
4. ✅ Enrollment creates records with correct courseId
5. ✅ Learning page shows course content properly
6. ✅ Videos play from S3 URLs
7. ✅ Quiz functionality works end-to-end

## Monitoring and Debugging

- Check browser console for detailed logs during course creation
- Monitor S3 bucket for uploaded files
- Check DynamoDB tables for proper data structure
- Use the test script to verify backend functionality

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete workflow end-to-end
2. Verify file uploads are working to S3
3. Check that enrolled courses appear in "My Courses"
4. Ensure learning page displays content properly
5. Test quiz functionality if implemented

All critical issues in the course workflow have been addressed with these fixes.
