# Blocking Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the blocking functionality for both Staff and Recruiter users, including the blocked user experience and help request system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### Authentication Controller Updates (`authController.js`)
- **Modified Login Function**: Now checks if user is blocked and returns appropriate response
- **Added Request Help Function**: Handles help requests from blocked users
- **Blocked User Response**: Returns `blocked: true` flag for blocked users with limited user data

#### Admin Controller Updates (`adminController.js`)
- **Fixed Recruiter Visibility Toggle**: Now uses separate `isVisible` field instead of `isBlocked`
- **Proper Blocking System**: Both staff and recruiters use the same blocking mechanism
- **Consistent State Management**: Visibility and blocking are now separate concerns

#### Issue Controller (`issueController.js`)
- **Resolve Issue Function**: Unblocks users when issues are resolved
- **User Lookup**: Finds users by email to unblock them
- **Issue Management**: Complete CRUD operations for help requests

#### Routes Updates
- **Auth Routes**: Added `/api/auth/request-help` endpoint
- **Admin Routes**: All recruiter management routes properly configured

### 2. Database Integration

#### Tables Used
- `staffinn-users`: User accounts with `isBlocked` and `isVisible` fields
- `staffinn-issue-section`: Help requests from blocked users

#### Data Structure
```javascript
// User blocking fields
{
  isBlocked: boolean,    // Controls access to the platform
  isVisible: boolean     // Controls visibility on public listings
}

// Issue/Help request structure
{
  issuesection: string,  // Partition key (UUID)
  name: string,
  email: string,
  query: string,
  status: string,        // 'pending' | 'resolved'
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string
}
```

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### AuthContext Updates (`AuthContext.jsx`)
- **Blocked User Detection**: Checks for blocked status in login response
- **Blocked Screen Management**: Shows/hides blocked user screen
- **Session Handling**: Properly manages blocked user sessions

#### BlockedUser Component (`BlockedUser.jsx`)
- **Blocked Message Display**: Shows "You are blocked from Staffinn" message
- **Request Help Form**: Complete form for submitting help requests
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation screen after successful submission
- **API Integration**: Connects to backend help request endpoint

#### Login Integration (`LoginPopup.jsx`)
- **Blocked User Handling**: Properly handles blocked user login responses
- **Seamless Experience**: Automatically shows blocked screen when needed

### 4. User Experience Flow

#### Normal User Login
1. User enters email/password
2. Backend validates credentials
3. If valid and not blocked → Normal dashboard access
4. If valid but blocked → Blocked user screen

#### Blocked User Experience
1. **Login Attempt**: User can still log in with valid credentials
2. **Blocked Screen**: Shows "You are blocked from Staffinn" message
3. **Request Help Button**: Opens help request form
4. **Help Form**: User fills name, email, and query
5. **Submission**: Request stored in `staffinn-issue-section` table
6. **Confirmation**: Success message displayed

#### Admin Resolution Process
1. **Issues Section**: Admin sees all help requests
2. **User Details**: Shows user profile and submitted query
3. **Unblock Action**: Admin clicks "Unblock" button
4. **Automatic Unblock**: User's `isBlocked` status set to `false`
5. **Issue Resolution**: Issue marked as resolved

### 5. Admin Panel Features

#### Staff Section
- **Block/Unblock**: Toggle user access
- **Hide/Show**: Toggle profile visibility
- **Consistent Actions**: Same blocking behavior across all user types

#### Recruiter Section
- **Fixed Visibility Toggle**: Now works properly with separate `isVisible` field
- **Block/Unblock**: Same functionality as staff blocking
- **Profile Management**: Complete CRUD operations

#### Issues Section
- **Help Request Display**: Shows all submitted help requests
- **User Information**: Displays user profile details
- **Unblock Functionality**: One-click user unblocking
- **Issue Management**: Mark as resolved or delete

### 6. Security Features

#### Session Management
- **Automatic Logout**: Blocked users are logged out when blocked
- **Token Validation**: Blocked users cannot access protected endpoints
- **State Consistency**: Frontend and backend blocking states synchronized

#### Access Control
- **API Protection**: Blocked users cannot access protected APIs
- **Dashboard Restriction**: Blocked users see only the blocked screen
- **Help Request Only**: Blocked users can only submit help requests

### 7. Real-time Features

#### Immediate Effect
- **Instant Blocking**: Users are immediately logged out when blocked
- **Real-time Updates**: Admin panel reflects changes immediately
- **Session Invalidation**: Blocked users cannot continue using the platform

#### Unblocking Process
- **Immediate Access**: Unblocked users can log in normally on next attempt
- **Dashboard Restoration**: Full platform access restored
- **No Residual Restrictions**: Complete functionality restoration

### 8. Technical Implementation

#### Backend Flow
```javascript
// Login process
1. Validate credentials
2. Check isBlocked status
3. If blocked: return { success: true, blocked: true, user: limitedData }
4. If not blocked: return normal login response with tokens

// Help request process
1. Receive help request
2. Store in staffinn-issue-section table
3. Return success confirmation

// Unblock process
1. Find user by email from issue
2. Set isBlocked = false
3. Mark issue as resolved
```

#### Frontend Flow
```javascript
// Login handling
1. Call login API
2. Check response.blocked flag
3. If blocked: show BlockedUser component
4. If not blocked: proceed to dashboard

// Blocked user experience
1. Show blocked message
2. Provide help request form
3. Submit to backend
4. Show success confirmation
```

### 9. Error Handling

#### Backend Validation
- **Required Fields**: Name, email, and query validation
- **User Lookup**: Proper error handling for user not found
- **Database Errors**: Graceful error handling and logging

#### Frontend Validation
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for help requests
- **API Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed requests
- **Loading States**: User feedback during API calls

### 10. Testing Scenarios

#### Blocking Flow
1. Admin blocks a user
2. User is automatically logged out
3. User tries to log in → sees blocked screen
4. User submits help request
5. Admin resolves issue
6. User can log in normally

#### Edge Cases
- **Multiple Sessions**: All user sessions invalidated when blocked
- **Concurrent Requests**: Proper handling of simultaneous operations
- **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation and retry mechanisms

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Login with blocking check
- `POST /api/v1/auth/request-help` - Submit help request

### Admin Management
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/staff/toggle-block/:userId` - Block/unblock staff
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/recruiter/toggle-block/:recruiterId` - Block/unblock recruiter
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/recruiter/toggle-visibility/:recruiterId` - Show/hide recruiter

### Issues Management
- `GET /api/v1/admin/issues` - Get all help requests
- `PUT /api/v1/admin/issues/:issueId/resolve` - Resolve issue and unblock user
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/issues/:issueId` - Delete issue

## Conclusion

The blocking functionality is now fully implemented with:

✅ **Complete User Experience**: Blocked users see appropriate screens and can request help
✅ **Admin Control**: Full blocking/unblocking capabilities for all user types
✅ **Real-time Effects**: Immediate blocking and unblocking with session management
✅ **Help Request System**: Complete workflow from user request to admin resolution
✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Same blocking mechanism for staff and recruiters
✅ **Security**: Proper access control and session invalidation
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback

The system maintains all existing functionality while adding comprehensive blocking capabilities that work seamlessly across the entire platform.
