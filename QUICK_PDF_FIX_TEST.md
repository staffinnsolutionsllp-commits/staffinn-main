# Quick PDF Fix Test

## Issue
PDF files are not being saved in the Industry Collaboration section.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Controller (`instituteController.js`)
- Fixed all `null` assignments to use empty strings (`''`) instead
- Added detailed logging for PDF file processing
- Enhanced error handling for PDF uploads

### 2. Backend Model (`instituteIndustryCollabModel.js`)
- Changed PDF URL storage from `null` to empty string (`''`)
- Fixed filtering logic to handle empty strings properly

### 3. Frontend Dashboard (`InstituteDashboard.jsx`)
- Enhanced PDF file selection logging
- Fixed PDF URL initialization to use empty strings

### 4. Frontend API Service (`api.js`)
- Added detailed logging for FormData PDF file attachment
- Enhanced file upload tracking

## Testing Steps

1. **Open Browser Console** - Check for detailed logs
2. **Go to Institute Dashboard** ‚Üí Industry Collaborations
3. **Add MOU Item** with title and description
4. **Select PDF File** - Should see console log with file details
5. **Submit Form** - Check console for upload progress
6. **Verify Storage** - PDF URL should be stored (not empty)

## Expected Console Logs

### Frontend (Browser Console):
```
üìÅ PDF file selected for MOU: {mouTitle: "...", fileName: "...", fileSize: ..., fileType: "application/pdf"}
üìÅ PDF file added to FormData: {fieldName: "mouPdf_...", fileName: "...", fileSize: ...}
```

### Backend (Server Console):
```
üîç Looking for PDF file: mouPdf_... {fileExists: true, fileName: "...", fileSize: ...}
üì§ Attempting to upload PDF file...
üì§ Starting upload of 1 files of type: pdfs
‚úÖ File uploaded successfully: https://...
‚úÖ PDF uploaded successfully: https://...
```

## Quick Fix Summary

The main issue was **DynamoDB NULL handling**. When JavaScript `null` values are stored in DynamoDB, they become `{"NULL": true}`. By using empty strings (`''`) instead, we avoid this issue entirely.

**Before:** `pdfUrl: null` ‚Üí DynamoDB: `{"NULL": true}`
**After:** `pdfUrl: ''` ‚Üí DynamoDB: `""`

This allows proper storage and retrieval of PDF URLs while maintaining backward compatibility.
