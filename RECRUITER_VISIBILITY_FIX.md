# Recruiter Visibility Fix Implementation

## Problem
The hide/show functionality in the Master Admin Panel for recruiters was not working properly. When an admin would hide a recruiter, they would still appear on the main website's recruiter page.

## Root Cause
The public recruiter APIs (`getAllRecruitersPublic` and `getRecruiterByIdPublic`) were not filtering based on the `isVisible` field, so hidden recruiters were still being returned to the frontend.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend API Updates

#### Updated `getAllRecruitersPublic` function
```javascript
// Before: Only filtered by role
const recruiters = allUsers.filter(user => user.role === 'recruiter');

// After: Filters by role, blocked status, and visibility
const recruiters = allUsers.filter(user => 
  user.role === 'recruiter' && 
  !user.isBlocked && 
  user.isVisible !== false
);
```

#### Updated `getRecruiterByIdPublic` function
```javascript
// Before: Only checked role
if (!recruiter || recruiter.role !== 'recruiter') {
  return res.status(404).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Recruiter not found'
  });
}

// After: Checks role, blocked status, and visibility
if (!recruiter || recruiter.role !== 'recruiter' || recruiter.isBlocked || recruiter.isVisible === false) {
  return res.status(404).json({
    success: false,
    message: 'Recruiter not found'
  });
}
```

#### Updated Recruiter Registration
```javascript
// Added default visibility setting for new recruiters
const userData = {
  companyName: value.companyName,
  email: value.email,
  password: value.password,
  phoneNumber: value.phoneNumber,
  role: 'recruiter',
  website: value.website || null,
  isVisible: true // Default to visible when registering
};
```

### 2. Database Fields

#### User Table Structure
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  role: 'recruiter',
  isBlocked: boolean,    // Controls platform access
  isVisible: boolean,    // Controls public website visibility
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 3. Admin Panel Integration

#### Visibility Toggle Logic
- **Hide**: Sets `isVisible = false` → Recruiter disappears from public website
- **Show**: Sets `isVisible = true` → Recruiter appears on public website
- **Block**: Sets `isBlocked = true` → Recruiter cannot access platform
- **Unblock**: Sets `isBlocked = false` → Recruiter can access platform

## Real-time Functionality

### Admin Action Flow
1. **Admin clicks "Hide"** → API call to `/api/admin/recruiter/toggle-visibility/:recruiterId`
2. **Backend updates** → Sets `isVisible = false` in database
3. **Frontend updates** → Admin panel shows "Hidden" status
4. **Public website** → Recruiter no longer appears in listings

### User Experience Flow
1. **Public website calls** → `/api/recruiter/public/all`
2. **Backend filters** → Only returns visible, non-blocked recruiters
3. **Frontend displays** → Only visible recruiters shown to users
4. **Individual recruiter page** → Returns 404 for hidden recruiters

## API Endpoints Affected

### Public APIs (Now Respect Visibility)
- `GET /api/recruiter/public/all` - Lists only visible recruiters
- `GET /api/recruiter/public/:recruiterId` - Returns 404 for hidden recruiters

### Admin APIs (Control Visibility)
- `PUT /api/admin/recruiter/toggle-visibility/:recruiterId` - Toggle visibility
- `GET /api/admin/recruiter/users` - Shows all recruiters with visibility status

## Testing Scenarios

### Hide Functionality Test
1. Admin views recruiter list → Recruiter is visible
2. Admin clicks "Hide" → Status changes to "Hidden"
3. Public website → Recruiter no longer appears in listings
4. Direct recruiter URL → Returns 404 error

### Show Functionality Test
1. Admin views hidden recruiter → Status shows "Hidden"
2. Admin clicks "Show" → Status changes to "Visible"
3. Public website → Recruiter appears in listings again
4. Direct recruiter URL → Returns recruiter profile

### Real-time Updates
1. Admin hides recruiter → Immediate effect on public website
2. No caching issues → Changes reflect instantly
3. Database consistency → All APIs use same visibility logic

## Implementation Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **Blocking**: Controls platform access (login/dashboard)
- **Visibility**: Controls public website appearance
- **Independent**: Can hide without blocking, block without hiding

### Real-time Control
- **Immediate Effect**: Changes reflect instantly on public website
- **No Cache Issues**: Direct database queries ensure real-time updates
- **Consistent State**: All APIs use same filtering logic

### Admin Experience
- **Clear Status**: Visual indicators for visibility state
- **Easy Toggle**: One-click hide/show functionality
- **Immediate Feedback**: Status updates in admin panel

## Conclusion

The recruiter visibility functionality is now working correctly:

✅ **Hide Function**: Recruiters disappear from public website when hidden
✅ **Show Function**: Recruiters reappear on public website when shown
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Changes take effect immediately
✅ **Database Consistency**: All APIs respect the visibility setting
✅ **Admin Control**: Clear status indicators and easy toggle functionality

The fix ensures that admin visibility controls have immediate and consistent effects across the entire platform.
