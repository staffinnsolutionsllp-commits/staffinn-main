## Data Structure

### Collaboration Cards
```javascript
{
  title: "Partnership Title",
  company: "Company Name", 
  type: "Training Partner",
  description: "Partnership description",
  image: "https://s3-url/image.jpg" // S3 URL
}
```

### MOU Items
```javascript
{
  title: "MOU Title",
  description: "MOU description", 
  pdfUrl: "https://s3-url/document.pdf" // S3 URL
}
```

### Complete Data Structure
```javascript
{
  instituteinduscollab: "institute-user-id",
  instituteName: "Institute Name",
  collaborationCards: [/* array of collaboration objects */],
  mouItems: [/* array of MOU objects */],
  lastUpdated: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## File Upload Flow

### 1. Dashboard Form Submission
1. User fills collaboration forms with images/PDFs
2. Files are validated on client-side
3. FormData is created with files and metadata
4. Files are uploaded to S3 with unique identifiers
5. S3 URLs are stored in DynamoDB
6. Old unused files are automatically cleaned up

### 2. Public Display
1. Institute page loads collaboration data via API
2. Images and PDFs are displayed using S3 URLs
3. Error handling for missing/broken files
4. Fallback placeholders for missing images

## Security Features

### 1. File Validation
- File type restrictions (images: JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP, documents: PDF only)
- File size limits (5MB for images, 10MB for PDFs)
- Malicious file detection

### 2. Access Control
- Protected routes require authentication
- Institute can only modify their own data
- Public routes are read-only

### 3. S3 Security
- Unique file naming to prevent conflicts
- Automatic cleanup of unused files
- Proper CORS configuration

## Usage Instructions

4. **Notifications**: Alert when new collaborations are added
5. **Templates**: Pre-defined collaboration templates
6. **Approval Workflow**: Admin approval for collaborations

### Scalability Considerations
1. **CDN Integration**: CloudFront for faster file delivery
